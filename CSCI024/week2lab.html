  <h1>Week 2 Lab</h1>
  <p><em>You are a senior member of the security team at MiroLabs Inc.<br>
You have requested a meeting with the board to discuss implementing a robust security program.<br>
They have given you 5 minutes to make your case.<br> 
Using at least 5 of the key terms from Chapter 4, write a 500 word pitch for your proposed security improvement project.<br>
      </em></p>
    <p>
      Members of the Board: As you are aware, we track <b>key performance indicators</b> and <b>key risk indicators</b> to maintain our information technology infrastructure.
      We compare our <b>performance</b> to <b>baseline</b> measurements created when our systems are first configured to detect any degradation in <b>performance</b>
      as our systems age.
     We also perform <b>gap analysis</b>, comparing our security program to industry best security practices.
      This process has identified several opportunities for improvement.<br>
Specifically, our policy which requires employees to use their pet’s name as their password has proven to be less than optimal.
      Historically, when employees experience a breach potentially exposing their password to hostile actors, we have purchased new pets for each employee
      and required the affected employees to surrender their existing pets to the HR department. In some cases, it has taken weeks to find a replacement
      pet of the appropriate breed and sex and for the pet and/or employee to learn its new name. This unnecessary <b>latency</b> in the password change process
       has caused significant disruptions to our productivity and a <b>cost-benefit analysis</b> suggests that this policy’s downsides significantly outweigh its
      benefits. We experimented with prepurchasing dogs and cats of popular breeds and housing them in unused cubicles in anticipation of password changes,
      but this proved to have significant unforeseen downsides.<br>
Further, a comparison of our password change rate to our industry peers (we are significantly below average) suggests that our employees may avoid
      notifying IT about potential password breaches because they want to avoid replacing their pets. This <b>usability</b> issue thus has significant security
      implications which must be addressed. <br> 
We suggest moving from our current single-factor pet-based password policy to a standard two-factor authentication system.
      Our proposed system will allow employees to choose their own password (subject to minimum standards for length and character set diversity)
      and prove that they are in possession of a corporate-issued Yubikey device. The cost for each Yubikey is approximately $40, which is substantially
      less than a single purebred puppy (average price $1300). Each user is typically issued two Yubikeys – one primary device, and one backup in case the
      primary is lost or destroyed. The Yubikey devices are industry standard NIST 800-73-4 smartcards, and are compatible with Active Directory logins for
      both Windows and OS X. Yubikeys are also usable to manage logins for local machine accounts on Windows and OS X even when network connectivity is
unavailable, which is important for mobile users who may be at customer sites or travelling without access to our internal network. The Yubikey devices
      cannot be duplicated by end-users. Because the smartcard authentication process does not provide end users with the authentication information,
      this significantly reduces our exposure to phishing attacks. Users cannot unwittingly provide login credentials to impostors if the users do not have
      direct access to the login credentials.
We believe that implementing a robust two-factor authentication system can be done at a lower <b>total cost of ownership</b> than our existing system.
      The Yubikey system we propose will improve the <b>maintainability</b>, <b>scalability</b> and <b>usability</b> of our authentication system while providing stronger
      security for our organization and its corporate assets.
